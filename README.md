# Mastermind

Mastermind is a code braking game. One player creates a "code" of four colored pegs. The other player then guesses the code. Hints are given when the player guesses the correct colors in the wrong order or when the guess is correct.

When the code breaker guesses the exact order of the code, the game is over.

**TODO**
1. Create the code maker
1. Build the UI for guessing
1. Implement limit on the number of turns
